## Description
The purpose of this project is to use Multilayer perceptron models to try to predict if a person's income is above $50k or below $50k. The results found that our single layered model was both more effective and less computationally expensive to use, and we therefore decided that it was best for predicting outputs. The process for finding the best model parameters wasn't tuned as well as we would've liked, but any gridsearch would've been computationally expensive as well, particularly with multiple hidden layers. The final results on the single hidden layer model were about 85% accurate on untrained data, and the results on a validation set can be seen in the Github repository.
